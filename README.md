# CS 4540: Advanced Algorithms / CS 6515: Graduate Algorithms

This repository contains information / resources about two courses at Georgia Tech, CS 4540: Advanced Algorithms and CS 6515: Graduate Algorithms. I was a Head TA for both of these courses.

If you're an instructor or a TA of an algorithms course, feel free to use these resources for your classes! We only ask that you don't publicly release your solutions to these homeworks, in order to make this repository an effective teaching resource. If you'd like to know the solutions to any of the problems, please contact us.
